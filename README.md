T03: Predictive Model to Estimate Employee Performance

Description: The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating employee performance using machine learning methods. We will explore algorithms like Random Forest, XGBoost to train the model enabling it to identify employees who are most likely to succeed in their jobs.
